## 👋 About me

I'm a software development student based in **Madrid**.<br>
Originally from **Jerez de la Frontera**.<br>
I'm currently sailing through the 42 coding curriculum —<br>
building everything from tiny Unix shells to full IRC servers —<br>
and loving every stormy challenge along the way.<br>

<br><br>

## 💻 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **🌀 minishell**: A functional Unix shell that supports pipes, redirections, built-ins, and more.
- **🏝️ inception**: A Docker-based system architecture project to build a virtualized web server stack.
- **🤔 philosophers**: A multithreading simulation of the classic Dining Philosophers problem.
- **📡 ft_irc**: A basic IRC server implementing the core of the IRC protocol.
- **📦 push_swap**, **🧱 so_long**, **🧪 pipex**, **🧠 cub3D**, and more – covering everything from algorithm optimization to game development to 3D rendering.

## 🏴‍☠️ A Few Fun Facts

- 💥 My code compiles (most of the time).
- 🛹 I skate to clear my head and debug my life.
- 🕺 Breakdance is a real programming skill — it’s called *“flow control.”*
