## 👋 About me

I'm a software development student based in **Madrid**.<br>
Originally from **Jerez de la Frontera**.<br>
I'm currently sailing through the 42 coding curriculum —<br>
building everything from tiny Unix shells to full IRC servers —<br>
and loving every stormy challenge along the way.<br>
